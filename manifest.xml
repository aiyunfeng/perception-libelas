    <description brief="library from KIT to compute dense stereo images">
	Libelas (Library for Efficient Large-scale Stereo Matching) is a
	cross-platfrom (Linux, Windows) C++ library with MATLAB wrappers for
	computing disparity maps from rectified graylevel stereo pairs. It is robust
	against moderate changes in illumination and well suited for robotics
	applications with high resolution images. Computing the left and right
	disparity map of a one Megapixel image requires less than one second on a
	single i7 CPU core.
